### Why Create React App?
#### Create React App is a command line tool to build and deploy single-page React applications. It uses webpack and other packages under the hood for easy development setup. It is a great tool to use when you are first learning React as it lets you focus on writing components.

#### Each React application will include source code which is compiled into bundled javascript, and loaded into an HTML file. The source code is written in the src and HTML is output in the public folder.

### node_modules/
#### This folder contains all the 3rd party dependency modules which are installed in an application. This folder should not be included in the git repo as it is very large and other users can download the same versions from NPM. There is no need to change any of this code and it should be included in the .gitignore file.
